# empty lines

Hey there. This is my `empty lines` extension to handle empty lines in your code.

It's a relatively simple extension. It does two things:
1. Ensure there's a maximum of `x` empty lines in between code, and
2. Ensure there's `y` empty lines at the end of your code.

Documentation about the source code can be found in comments across the code.
