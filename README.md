# empty lines

Hey there. This repo contains the source of my 'empty lines' VSCode extension.

It's a relatively simple extension. It does:
1. Ensure there's a maximum of `x` empty lines in between code,
2. Ensure there's `y` empty lines at the end of your code, and
3. Fix indentation on empty lines.

Documentation about the source code can be found in comments across the code.
